## About the Analysis
This project takes in several Gutenberg ID's and titles for classic horror novels and performs text mining on them.


## Code Out
It will return jpeg word clouds and some plots showing the most commonly used words in each book and a sentiment analysis by chapter.

## To run the analysis
1. Open the R Project.
2. Create a "results/" folder in the top directory.
3. Make changes to the inputs as desired.
4. source("src/simulate_advdiff.R", chdir = TRUE)
